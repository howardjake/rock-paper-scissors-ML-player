# Rock Paper Scissors ML Challenge 

This is the Solution to a coding challenge that is created by freeCodeCamp in the "Machine Learning with Python" Course. 

Using a randomized training algorithm paired with a Markov Model algorithm the player function int RPS.py can on average achieve just upward of 60% win rate against the bots that freeCodeCamp supplies. 

You can run this on the connected Replit below. Just press Run and you can results in the termianl.
